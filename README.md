# Platform-Fighter-Roguelike

A prototype of a platform fighter based on Rivals of Aether/Super Smash Bros. Melee with rougelike-style mechanics in player movesets. Various aspects of a players moveset will be customizable from a randomly generated pool prior to games beginning.

## CURRENT TODO:

- implement smash-style initial dashes
- implement smash-style shielding
- clean up base particle system (ngl might just rewrite it)
- fix clipping issues
- fix wall jumps feeling weird
- adjust player movement params to a default that works
- create semi-solid platforms

## NEAR - FUTURE TODO:

- Animation system (god help me)
- Hitbox system that is modular enough to be adjusted on the fly (god help me)
  - This system will strongly be based on Smash Ultimate's system of creating hitbox objects functionally and assigning params all in one go
- Hurtbox system
- Projectile system

## FAR - FUTURE TODO

- Spriting (god help me)
- Stage design
- Rougelike mechanics
- UI design for all this
